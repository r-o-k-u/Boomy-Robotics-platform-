# Install WinUSB driver using Zadig for "Xbox NUI Motor"
Here's how to install the WinUSB driver for Kinect v1 using Zadig:

Step-by-Step Guide
Download Zadig
Get the latest version from the official site:
https://zadig.akeo.ie

Connect Kinect v1
Plug your Kinect into a USB 2.0+ port and wait for Windows to detect it.

Run Zadig as Administrator
Right-click Zadig â†’ "Run as administrator"

Configure Zadig:
Go to Options â†’ List All Devices

Zadig Options

Select Device:
From the dropdown, choose "Xbox NUI Motor (Interface 0)"

Select Xbox NUI Motor

Install WinUSB Driver:

Driver: Select WinUSB from the right-side dropdown

Click "Replace Driver"

Install WinUSB

Wait for Completion
You'll see a success message when done:
Driver Installation Complete!

Verification
Check Device Manager:
Under "Universal Serial Bus devices", you should see:
"WinUSB Device"

Device Manager

Test with Python:

python
import freenect
print(f"Found {freenect.num_devices()} Kinect devices")
Test with CLI Tool:

bash
freenect-glview
Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
Device not listed	Unplug/replug Kinect, ensure USB 2.0+ port
Driver install fails	Disable driver signature enforcement (Windows Advanced Startup)
Access denied errors	Run Zadig as Administrator
Depth sensor not working	Repeat steps for "Xbox NUI Motor (Interface 1)"
Important Notes
Do this once per USB port you use with Kinect

Required for both Windows 10 and 11

Not needed for Linux (works out-of-box with libfreenect)

After completing these steps, your Kinect v1 will work with libfreenect in Python! ðŸŽ‰

pip install flask numpy opencv-python
sudo apt-get install libfreenect-dev  # For Linux
